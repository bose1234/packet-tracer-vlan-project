# Cisco Packet Tracer VLAN-Based Network Simulation

### Created by Abosede Ogunlade

This project showcases a practical implementation of VLANs, routing, DHCP, and DNS within Cisco Packet Tracer. It is designed to mimic a real-world business network infrastructure using multiple switches, routers, and end devices.
