Cisco Packet Tracer project using VLANs, routers, DHCP, and DNS setup.
This project demonstrates a basic but structured network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes:

- VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40)
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP server configuration (`192.168.1.100`)
- DNS Server configuration (`192.168.4.5`)
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches
- Multiple end-user devices and servers
